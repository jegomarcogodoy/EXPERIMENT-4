EXPERIMENT-4 | JEGO MARCO E. GODOY | 2ECE-A

****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ******************

The use of data visualization and data wrangling is the main topic of Experiment 4. The purpose of this experiment is to recognize and use various codes and functions when developing a Python application with Data Wrangling and Visualization modules.

This experiment comprises only 1 problem:

(1) ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM - where I used the file "board2.csv" and uploaded its data into a data frame using pandas, and performed Data Wrangling and Visualization techniques.

********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************

For Number 1,

-- > First, I uploaded the data of the "board2.csv" file into the data frame "df"

-- > I then created 2 data frames with different parameters for each data frame:

-- > (a.) For the first data frame, named "Instru", the constants were the track as "Instrumentation" and hometown as "Luzon", and the variables displayed were the "Name", "GEAS", and "Electronics"

-- > (b.) For the second data frame, named "Mindy", the constants were the gender as "Female" and hometown as "Mindanao," and the variables displayed were the "Name", "Track", "Electronics", and "Average"

For the average, I computed the Average of the grades from all subjects

For Problem 2,

-- > Utilizing the data frame "board2" from Problem 1, I generated a bar graph showing the relation of the features to the average obtained by the students.

********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************

Following this experiment, I discovered how to:

(a.) to determine the various codes and features required for data cleaning and visualization

(b.)to implement and utilize the many functions and codes when developing a Python software for data visualization and wrangling.
